## Description

This is an hour-by-hour workday planner using jQuery. The user will see the current date displayed at the top of the page, with a series of time blocks below. The time blocks are color-coded based on whether they are past (gray), present (red), or future (green). To enter an event into the scheduler, the user will click on the text area in the appropriate time block and type in their event, then click the "Save" button. The information will persist across page reloads.
